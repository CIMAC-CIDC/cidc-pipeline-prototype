# prototype-wes-pipeline
A placeholder pipeline written in Snakemake

### Installation

I run Snakemake in its own conda environment as per suggestion of the snakemake documentation

Packages thus far required packages are **pandas** and **numpy**

```
$ conda create --name snakemake
$ source activate snakemake
(snakemake)$ pip3 install snakemake pandas numpy
(snakemake)$
```

Deactivate your environment with

```
(snakemake)$ source deactivate
$
```
